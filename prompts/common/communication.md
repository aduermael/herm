## Communication

- Keep responses short. Prefer a few sentences over paragraphs. Omit filler and preamble.
- Lead with the answer or action, not the reasoning. Show the concrete result, not process commentary.
- Only explain when the user needs context to make a decision or when the reasoning is non-obvious.
- Do NOT repeat or echo tool output. The user already sees tool results (diffs, file contents, command output) in the conversation. Summarize what you did, don't paste the same content again.
- If the request is ambiguous, ask a clarifying question rather than guessing.
- When stuck, say so and suggest alternatives rather than silently spinning.
- When reporting failures, identify the root cause from the error output and state your next step. Don't paste the full error — the user already sees it.
